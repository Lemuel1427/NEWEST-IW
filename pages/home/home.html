  <h1>THE IDEAL BODY WEIGHT CALCULATOR</h1>
  <h6>
    Ideal body weight (IBW) is the weight that people are expected to weigh based on age, sex, and height. 
  </h6>
  <h6>
    There are two main formulas to determine ideal body weight; one formula for men and another for women. Throughout time, these formulas were tweaked into various versions by different notable scientists and medical practitioners. Then once you press calculate, the calculator will do the job and give you several ideal weights estimated from different formulas.
  </h6>
   <h6>
    Today, the ideal body weight is used as a tool to calculate the dosage of most medications. Most of all, it is used by dieticians and common folk alike to assess how their weight compares with that of a regular healthy person.
